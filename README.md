## Finishing Remarks & Thoughts

This project took about 7 hours to complete.

## Features & Improvements

* __Buttons__: Satisfying animations and colors on hover & click

* __JS__ : Slightly more involved (rather than basic style changing) JS logic required

## Issues & Todo

* __Responsiveness__ : The page does not shrink in any capacity - this is mostly by design. I would like for the canvas to shrink/grow while maintaining aspect ratio. I've found it to be too small on larger screens (but perfect on smaller screens).
